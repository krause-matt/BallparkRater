# Ballpark Rater App

Ballpark Rater is an app for locating and reviewing professional baseball stadiums in North America. This is the first full-stack app I created when learning web development. Below are some of the details of Ballpark Rater.

### Frontend

The app is written in JavaScript and styled mainly using Bootstrap.

### Backend

The routing server is handled with Express. Routes are defined using RESTful convention. Middleware is included in server requests for situations like error handling, message display, and authentication/authorization.

### Database

Mongo is used as the database to store user information, ballpark details, and reviews.
